# 📊 Chocolate Sales Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data for a chocolate manufacturer to uncover actionable business insights. Using **Power BI**, I transformed raw sales datasets into an interactive dashboard that tracks revenue, profit margins, and consumer behavior. This project demonstrates my ability to bridge the gap between data engineering and business intelligence.

## 🚀 Key Analysis Features
* **Financial KPIs**: Real-time tracking of **Total Revenue**, **Total Profit**, and **Profit Margin %** using custom DAX measures.
* **Geographical Distribution**: Map visualizations used to identify top-performing regions and under-penetrated markets.
* **Product Category Analysis**: Deep dive into chocolate types to determine high-volume vs. high-margin products.
* **Sales Trends**: Time-series analysis to identify seasonal peaks and month-over-month growth.

## 🛠️ Data Analysis Workflow
1.  [cite_start]**ETL Process (Power Query)**: Cleaned and transformed raw data[cite: 43], handled missing values, and optimized data types for efficient modeling.
2.  **Data Modeling**: Created a robust star schema by establishing relationships between Product, Geography, and Sales tables.
3.  **DAX Development**: Authored complex Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) for dynamic calculations such as **Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales** and **Average Order Value**.
4.  **UI/UX Design**: Built an intuitive dashboard with slicers and cross-filtering capabilities for seamless data exploration.
